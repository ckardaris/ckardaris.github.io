Hi! My name is Charalampos Kardaris.

I am a Computer Engineer from Greece. I graduated from the National Technical
University of Athens in 2020 and now I am working as a Junior Research Engineer
at Barcelona Supercomputing Center.

I am normal. I think.

I like talking about technology, sports and music among other things. Sometimes
I am an avid book reader.

I intend to use this small space in the vast internet to express my thoughts,
show my projects and share things that I find interesting in general.
