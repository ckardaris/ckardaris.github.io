Hi! My name is Charalampos Kardaris.

I am a computer engineer from Greece. I graduated from the National Technical
University of Athens in 2020 and now I am working as a software engineer for
[Codasip](https://www.codasip.com/).

I like talking about technology, sports and music among other things. I also
like reading books.
