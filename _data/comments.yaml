  comment: "I think I'm very lucky to be the first to experience this function.\n\
    I think the author's idea is very innovative. Maybe in the near future, I will\

  comment: 'Hello. Thanks for this first comment. You have a special place in this
    website now.


    And your comment provides some good feedback, as well. For example, I should make
    a "preview" functionality, so that you can see how the comment will look like
    once rendered in markdown.

    I knew that in China there are centralized apps that you can use for everything,
    but I did not know that they have made email obsolete for many people. Interesting.'
