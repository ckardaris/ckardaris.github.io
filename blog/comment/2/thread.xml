  <subtitle>&lt;p&gt;Hello. Thanks for this first comment. You have a special place in this website now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And your comment provides some good feedback, as well. For example, I should make a "preview" functionality, so that you can see how the comment will look like once rendered in markdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, for instance in China, many people neither have nor use email accounts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew that in China there are centralized apps that you can use for everything, but I did not know that they have made email obsolete for many people. Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;</subtitle>
