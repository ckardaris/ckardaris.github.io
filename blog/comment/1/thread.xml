  <subtitle>&lt;p&gt;I think I'm very lucky to be the first to experience this function.
I think the author's idea is very innovative. Maybe in the near future, I will be able to use this technology. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost everyone using the internet has an email address. In fact, for instance in China, many people neither have nor use email accounts.
Of course, this is not the main point of this article, and there is no need to pay too much attention to it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hello. Thanks for this first comment. You have a special place in this website now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And your comment provides some good feedback, as well. For example, I should make a "preview" functionality, so that you can see how the comment will look like once rendered in markdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, for instance in China, many people neither have nor use email accounts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew that in China there are centralized apps that you can use for everything, but I did not know that they have made email obsolete for many people. Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;</content>
