  Hello. Thanks for this first comment. You have a special place in this website now.

  And your comment provides some good feedback, as well. For example, I should make a "preview" functionality, so that you can see how the comment will look like once rendered in markdown.

  I knew that in China there are centralized apps that you can use for everything, but I did not know that they have made email obsolete for many people. Interesting.
